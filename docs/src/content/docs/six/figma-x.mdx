# Basic Usage

The simplest way to embed a Figma design is to provide the embed URL.

## Getting the Embed URL

To get the proper embed URL from Figma:

1. Open your Figma file, prototype, or component
2. Click the "Share" button in the top right
3. Click "Get embed code"
4. Copy the URL from the `src` attribute of the iframe code

## Simple Embed

``` astro
<FigmaX url="https://www.figma.com/embed?embed_host=share&url=YOUR_FIGMA_URL" />
```

<FigmaX 
  url="https://www.figma.com/embed?embed_host=share&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.figma.com%2Fdesign%2FHiNQ0kmWACSgJXt7XT8VxK%2FPhosphor-Icons--Community-%3Fnode-id%3D8899-89934%26p%3Df%26t%3Dipg3EcXoAAFFalBP-0"
/>

# Sizing Options

The FigmaX component supports various sizing options using standard CSS units.

## Fixed Dimensions

``` astro
<FigmaX 
  url="https://www.figma.com/embed?embed_host=share&url=..." 
  width="800px"
  height="600px"
/>
```

<FigmaX 
  url="https://www.figma.com/embed?embed_host=share&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.figma.com%2Fdesign%2FHiNQ0kmWACSgJXt7XT8VxK%2FPhosphor-Icons--Community-%3Fnode-id%3D8899-89934%26p%3Df%26t%3Dipg3EcXoAAFFalBP-0"
  width="800px"
  height="500px"
/>

## Percentage Width

``` astro
<FigmaX 
  url="https://www.figma.com/embed?embed_host=share&url=..." 
  width="80%"
  height="500px"
/>
```

<FigmaX 
  url="https://www.figma.com/embed?embed_host=share&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.figma.com%2Fdesign%2FHiNQ0kmWACSgJXt7XT8VxK%2FPhosphor-Icons--Community-%3Fnode-id%3D8899-89934%26p%3Df%26t%3Dipg3EcXoAAFFalBP-0"
  width="80%"
  height="400px"
/>

## Viewport Units

``` astro
<FigmaX 
  url="https://www.figma.com/embed?embed_host=share&url=..." 
  width="90vw"
  height="70vh"
/>
```

## Rem Units

``` astro
<FigmaX 
  url="https://www.figma.com/embed?embed_host=share&url=..." 
  width="100%"
  height="30rem"
/>
```

# Advanced Usage

## Mobile Prototype Preview

For mobile prototypes, use appropriate dimensions:

``` astro
<div style="max-width: 375px; margin: 0 auto;">
  <FigmaX 
    url="https://www.figma.com/embed?embed_host=share&url=..." 
    width="100%"
    height="812px"
  />
</div>
```

## Side-by-Side Designs

Compare multiple designs using the GridX component:

``` astro
<GridX cols={2} gap="1rem">
  <FigmaX 
    slot="col1"
    url="https://www.figma.com/embed?embed_host=share&url=..." 
    height="400px"
  />
  <FigmaX 
    slot="col2"
    url="https://www.figma.com/embed?embed_host=share&url=..." 
    height="400px"
  />
</GridX>
```

## Responsive Embed

For responsive behavior, use percentage widths and viewport units:

``` astro
<FigmaX 
  url="https://www.figma.com/embed?embed_host=share&url=..." 
  width="100%"
  height="min(70vh, 600px)"
/>
```

----

# Embed Types

The FigmaX component supports various types of Figma content:

## Design Files

Embed complete design files or specific frames:

``` astro
<FigmaX url="https://www.figma.com/embed?embed_host=share&url=https://www.figma.com/file/..." />
```

## Interactive Prototypes

Embed prototypes with transitions and interactions:

``` astro
<FigmaX 
  url="https://www.figma.com/embed?embed_host=share&url=https://www.figma.com/proto/..." 
  width="375px"
  height="812px"
/>
```

## Design System Components

Showcase individual components from your design system:

``` astro
<FigmaX 
  url="https://www.figma.com/embed?embed_host=share&url=..." 
  width="100%"
  height="400px"
/>
```

## FigJam Boards

Embed collaborative whiteboard content:

# Best Practices

- Use appropriate dimensions based on your content type (mobile prototypes vs. desktop designs)
- Test embed URLs to ensure they work correctly and have proper permissions
- Consider using percentage widths for responsive behavior
- Use viewport units for full-screen experiences when appropriate
- Provide meaningful context around embedded designs
- Ensure Figma files have proper sharing permissions for embedding

----

# What to Avoid

- **Don't use regular Figma share URLs** - Always use the embed URL from "Get embed code"
- **Don't embed private files without proper permissions** - Ensure files are accessible to your audience
- **Don't use fixed pixel dimensions for responsive layouts** - Use percentages or viewport units instead
- **Don't embed too many large files on one page** - This can impact performance
- **Don't forget to test embeds** - URLs can change if files are moved or permissions change
- **Don't use extremely large dimensions** - Consider your users' screen sizes and bandwidth
