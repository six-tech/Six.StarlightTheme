# Custom CSS

To customize the styles applied to your Starlight site when using the Starlight Six theme, you can providing additional CSS files to modify or extend the Starlight and the Starlight Six theme default styles.

[Learn more about custom CSS in the Starlight documentation.](https://starlight.astro.build/guides/css-and-tailwind/#custom-css-styles)

# Cascade layers

Like Starlight, the Starlight Six theme uses [cascade layers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Cascade_layers) internally to manage the order of its styles.
This ensures a predictable CSS order and allows for simpler overrides.
Any custom unlayered CSS will override the default styles from the `starlight` and `six` layers.

If you are using cascade layers, you can use [`@layer`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@layer) in your [custom CSS](https://starlight.astro.build/guides/css-and-tailwind/#custom-css-styles) to define the order of precedence for different layers relative to the Starlight and Starlight Six theme styles:

``` css "starlight" "six"
/* src/styles/custom.css */
@layer my-reset, starlight, six, my-overrides;
```

The example above defines a custom layer named `my-reset`, applied before all the Starlight and Starlight Six theme layers, and another named `my-overrides`, applied after all Starlight and Starlight Six theme layers.
Any styles in the `my-overrides` layer would take precedence over the Starlight and Starlight Six theme styles, but Starlight or the Starlight Six theme could still change styles set in the `my-reset` layer.

# Tailwind CSS

Following the [Tailwind CSS installation guide](https://starlight.astro.build/guides/css-and-tailwind/#create-a-new-project-with-tailwind).
