# Basic Card

The basic `Card` component displays content with an optional title and icon.

import { Card, CardGrid, LinkCard } from '@astrojs/starlight/components'

## Simple Card

```jsx
<Card title="Basic Card Example">
  This is a simple card that displays content with a title. Perfect for highlighting important information or grouping related content.
</Card>
```

</Card>
```

# Card Grids

Use `CardGrid` to arrange multiple cards in a responsive grid layout.

## Basic Grid

```jsx
<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Feature One" icon="star">
    This card showcases the first feature with an icon and description.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Feature Two" icon="moon">
    This card showcases the second feature with a different icon.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Feature Three" icon="heart">
    This card showcases the third feature with another icon.
  </Card>
</CardGrid>
```

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Feature One" icon="star">
    This card showcases the first feature with an icon and description.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Feature Two" icon="moon">
    This card showcases the second feature with a different icon.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Feature Three" icon="heart">
    This card showcases the third feature with another icon.
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

## Staggered Grid

```jsx
<CardGrid stagger>
  <Card title="Staggered Card 1" icon="star">
    This card appears with a staggered animation effect.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Staggered Card 2" icon="moon">
    The stagger effect creates visual interest and guides the eye.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Staggered Card 3" icon="heart">
    Each card appears with a slight delay for better UX.
  </Card>
</CardGrid>
```

<CardGrid stagger>
  <Card title="Staggered Card 1" icon="star">
    This card appears with a staggered animation effect.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Staggered Card 2" icon="moon">
    The stagger effect creates visual interest and guides the eye.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Staggered Card 3" icon="heart">
    Each card appears with a slight delay for better UX.
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

# Link Cards

`LinkCard` components are clickable cards that navigate to other pages or sections.

## Single Link Card

```jsx
<LinkCard
  title="Getting Started Guide"
  description="Learn the basics of using the Six Starlight Theme with our comprehensive getting started guide."
  href="#"
/>
```

<LinkCard
  title="Getting Started Guide"
  description="Learn the basics of using the Six Starlight Theme with our comprehensive getting started guide."
  href="#"
/>

## Link Cards in Grid

```jsx
<CardGrid>
  <LinkCard 
    title="Documentation" 
    description="Browse our comprehensive documentation"
    href="#" 
  />
  <LinkCard 
    title="Examples" 
    description="View practical examples and use cases"
    href="#" 
  />
  <LinkCard 
    title="Components" 
    description="Explore available components and their usage"
    href="#" 
  />
</CardGrid>
```

<CardGrid>
  <LinkCard 
    title="Documentation" 
    description="Browse our comprehensive documentation"
    href="#" 
  />
  <LinkCard 
    title="Examples" 
    description="View practical examples and use cases"
    href="#" 
  />
  <LinkCard 
    title="Components" 
    description="Explore available components and their usage"
    href="#" 
  />
</CardGrid>

# Advanced Usage

## Custom Card Styling

Cards automatically inherit the theme's styling but you can customize their appearance using CSS custom properties.

## Responsive Behavior

Card grids automatically adjust their layout based on screen size:
- **Mobile**: Single column layout
- **Tablet**: Two-column layout  
- **Desktop**: Three or more columns depending on available space

## Icon Support

The icon system supports various icon sets and can be customized through the theme configuration.

# Best Practices

- Use cards to group related information logically
- Keep card titles concise and descriptive
- Use icons consistently across similar card types
- Ensure link cards have clear, actionable descriptions
- Use staggered effects sparingly for special sections
- Maintain consistent spacing and alignment in grids
- Test card layouts on different screen sizes

----

# What to Avoid

- **Don't overload cards with too much content** - Keep them focused and scannable
- **Don't use cards for simple text content** - Use regular paragraphs instead
- **Don't mix different card types in the same grid** - Maintain visual consistency
- **Don't use cards for navigation menus** - Use proper navigation components
- **Don't create overly complex card hierarchies** - Keep the structure simple and intuitive
- **Don't use cards without clear purpose** - Each card should serve a specific function
