# Introduction

The Steps component creates a visual numbered list that's perfect for tutorials, installation guides, and any process that requires sequential instructions. It automatically numbers each step and provides a clear visual hierarchy with proper styling and spacing. Steps can contain various types of content including text, code blocks, and even nested steps.

## Import
First import `Steps` component with:

``` js
import { Steps } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';
```


## Props

| Prop Name | Prop Type | Description |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| `children` | `ReactNode` | Numbered list items that define the steps |

   ---
   title: Getting Started
   ---

   # Welcome to my documentation!
   ```

</Steps>
````

<Steps>

   # Welcome to my documentation!
   ```

</Steps>

## Steps with Mixed Content

````jsx
<Steps>

1. **Project Setup** - Begin by setting up your development environment.

   Make sure you have Node.js version 18 or higher installed before proceeding.

2. **Configuration** - Configure your project with the necessary settings.

   | Setting | Value | Description |
   |---------|-------|-------------|
   | `title` | `string` | Site title |
   | `description` | `string` | Site description |

3. **Testing** - Test your configuration to ensure everything works correctly.

   Run the development server and verify that your site loads properly.

# Nested Steps

The Steps component supports nesting for complex processes that require sub-steps.

## Complex Process with Sub-steps

````jsx
<Steps>

1. **Main Process** - Start with the primary task.

   This is the main step that contains sub-processes.

   <Steps>

   1. **Sub-step A** - Complete the first sub-task.

      ```js
      // Example code for sub-step A
      const stepA = 'completed';
      ```

   2. **Sub-step B** - Complete the second sub-task.

      Additional details for the second sub-step.

   </Steps>

2. **Final Step** - Complete the overall process.

   This step concludes the main process after all sub-steps are completed.

# Advanced Usage

## Steps with Rich Content

Steps can contain any valid markdown content including asides, code blocks, and interactive elements.

````jsx
<Steps>

1. **Installation** - Install the theme package.

   ```bash
   npm install @six/starlight-theme
   ```

   This will add the theme to your project dependencies.

2. **Configuration** - Add the theme to your configuration.

   Update your `astro.config.mjs` file with the theme configuration.

# Best Practices

- Use steps for truly sequential processes where order matters
- Keep each step focused on a single action or concept
- Use clear, actionable language in step descriptions
- Include code examples when relevant to the step
- Use nested steps for complex processes with sub-tasks
- Test your steps on different devices to ensure readability
- Keep the total number of main steps reasonable (typically 3-10 steps)


----


# What to Avoid

- **Don't use steps for non-sequential content** - Use regular headings or lists instead
- **Don't create too many nested levels** - Keep nesting to 2-3 levels maximum
- **Don't use steps for navigation** - Use proper navigation components
- **Don't hide essential information in steps** - Critical details should be clearly visible
- **Don't create overly complex step hierarchies** - Keep the structure simple and logical
- **Don't use steps without clear purpose** - Each step should advance the process meaningfully
- **Don't mix different step numbering systems** - Let the component handle numbering automatically
