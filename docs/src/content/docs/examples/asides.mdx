# Introduction

Asides are callout components that help highlight important information, tips, warnings, and notes in your documentation. They provide visual emphasis and help readers quickly identify different types of content. The Six Starlight Theme supports both markdown-based asides and component-based asides with consistent styling.

## Props

| Prop Name  | Prop Type                                  | Description                                                           |
|------------|--------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `type`     | `'note' \| 'tip' \| 'caution' \| 'danger'` | The type of aside to display. Determines the visual styling and icon. |
| `children` | `ReactNode`                                | The content to display inside the aside.                              |

# Best Practices
----

- Use **note** for general information and context
- Use **tip** for helpful advice and best practices  
- Use **caution** for warnings about potential issues
- Use **danger** for critical warnings and potential problems
- Keep aside content concise and focused
- Use asides sparingly to avoid overwhelming the reader
- Ensure the content inside asides is relevant and valuable

# What to Avoid
----

- **Don't overuse asides** - Too many asides can make content harder to read
- **Don't put essential information only in asides** - Important content should be in the main text
- **Don't use asides for navigation** - Use proper navigation components instead
- **Don't nest asides** - This can create confusing visual hierarchies
- **Don't use asides for decorative purposes** - They should always serve a functional purpose
